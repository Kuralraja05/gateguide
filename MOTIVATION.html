<h3>Let us now concentrate on few Important points:</h3><br>
<p><b>Analyze GATE syllabus:</b> Start with analyzing the GATE syllabus. Start divide and Conquer, try to break the syllabus into sub-categories and do the same with each subject further. It will help you to prioritize subjects and important topics in each subject. After doing this, you will get a clear insight into where you stand and how far is left to cover. Analyzing syllabus will also help you to understand about the important subjects and pattern of GATE exam.</p>
<p><b>Start preparing today : </b>Time is like money, so spend it wisely. The best time to start your GATE preparation is today, just after completing this read. Just pick one of the subjects you feel good and start the preparation. You may start with some easy and scoring subjects like DBMS, Operating Systems or Computer Networks(totally depends on individual). After completing first subject and its GATE questions, you can immediately pick the second subject. As soon as two subjects are completely covered, you will start feeling more confident.
After completing one subject, the immediately next task should be solving previously asked GATE questions of that subject. It will help you to uncover weak topics; try to recover those weak topics and resolve those questions.</p>
<p><b>Follow a disciplined schedule :</b> Make a schedule and follow it at any cost, literally. Decide a fixed number of hours for your GATE preparation and complete it daily; remember, consistency is a compulsion here. Maybe print a calendar from starting day to intended course completion day and stick it front of your study table. Every day you completed those hours, mark the date with green pen and do the same with red pen if you missed.</p>
<p><b>Take running notes while studying:</b> Note down the important points in notebook while covering the topics. It will definitely help you in revisions. Decide one day in a week to revise one of your previously completed subjects and use your GATE notes here.</p>
<p><b>Subjects easy to score:</b> There are few subjects which are easier to score, like Digital Logic, Mathematics and Aptitude. These three subjects cover 25-28% of complete GATE paper. Try not to leave these subjects uncovered as they are high scoring and will help to boost your GATE AIR.</p>
<p><b>Track your preparation periodically: </b>Solve previous GATE question for each subject. It will help you to recall and revise the subjects. We highly recommend giving Sudo GATE subject-wise Test series since these tests are build on learning while solving approach.</p>
<p><b>Revise and practice are keys to GATE: </b>After completing each subject, start revising each subject thoroughly. Revise the subject then solve previous year GATE questions and take subject-wise tests. Remember, the only keys to score good AIR is revise and practice more.</p>
<p><b>Take Mock Tests:</b> At this final stage of preparation, practicing quality questions before attempting actual GATE will boost your confidence and improve your problem-solving speed. GeeksforGeeks has specially designed Sudo GATE Mock tests, which will help in boosting your GATE score. Questions in these Mock Test resembles with GATE actual questions and will give the GATE aspirants trailer before the Film.</p>

<p><b>Use short notes : </b>At this crucial stage, don’t try to read any new topic. Just use your Last Minutes Notes to recall only key points in each subject. We highly recommend using these LMNs, specially designed for last minutes preparation.</p>
