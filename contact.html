  <p>When creating a website, developers have to make their client’s vision a reality. They work with clients to make sure it fits in with the type of site it is supposed to be, such as ecommerce, news, or gaming. Different types of websites may require different applications to work right. For example, a gaming site should be able to handle advanced graphics while an ecommerce site needs a payment processing application. The developer decides which applications and designs will best fit the site.</p>
  <p> We are create the site’s layout and integrate graphics; applications, such as a retail checkout tool; and other content into the site. They also write web-design programs in a variety of computer languages, such as HTML or JavaScript.</p>
